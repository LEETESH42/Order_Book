# Order_Book
This project implements a limit order book for simulating trading scenarios, where buy and sell orders are matched based on price and time priority. It includes functionalities for order addition, cancellation, matching, and execution, supporting different order types like Good-Till-Cancel and Fill-and-Kill.
